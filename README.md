# linux-journey
My notes and scripts while learning Linux and DevOps.
Starting my DevOps path in 2026.
Key commands I learned today:
* ls - List files
* cd - Change directory

/ - bottom of the system or root directory - Can not manipulate any directory or file here unless you use 'sudo'
/home - you can only see the users - Can not manipulate any directory or file here
~ - Users personal folder - manipulation are done here
